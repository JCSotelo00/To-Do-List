Notes:

Struggles for:


What I learned:
Log 1: lower() solves the issues with lowercase/uppercase.

Log 2: was tricky learning how to make lists. i was appending a string by mistake, when i need to append a task i need
to put the list first, then the variable afterwards. should look like this: tasklist.append(added_task)

Log 3: Finished the project.
