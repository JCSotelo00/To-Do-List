Notes:

Struggles for today:
-Need to find a way to have strings ignore capitalizations
-Have to find a way to have my else statement automatically retry to enter choice instead of outputting a string
-Research ways to make programs/functions and call them
-Research Exceptions and Break

What I learned today:
Log 1: \n creates a newline but i need to research a way to make it so that newlines dont automatically put a space in the next line/sentence.
Created the basic menu and some basic if/elif/else functions, obviously needs more work. I am wondering if there is away to make the 
string under '# greet user' more compact.

Log 2: indentation is very important.
