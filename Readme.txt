Notes:

Struggles for today:
working on the else statement to have it ask the input question again.

What I learned today:
Log 1: Figured out how to create and call functions i make.

Log 2: Finally figured out how to make the else statement prompt the input question again. Had to create a while loop but i kept
creating bugs where it would either break the loop and wouldnt prompt the question again. Or it would print "invalid answer" an
infinite amount of times. i finally just removed the continue/break underneath the print for else and it all came together.
